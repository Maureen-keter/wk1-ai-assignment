## 🧠 Code Overview

* The course data is stored in a JavaScript array of objects.
* Each course contains:

  ```javascript
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Introduction to HTML",
    description: "Learn the basics of HTML structure and tags.",
    lessons: ["HTML Basics", "Elements and Attributes", "Links & Images"],
    progress: 0
  }
  ```
* Clicking a course displays its details, lessons, and progress bar.
* The "Mark as Completed" button updates progress to **100%**.
